# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is an exercise I did to try out [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

To run this project, first clone it, then inside the project directory run `npm install && npm start` or alternatively, if you want to see the final production output, run `npm run build` followd by `npm run serve` then [open this page in your browser](http://localhost:5000)
